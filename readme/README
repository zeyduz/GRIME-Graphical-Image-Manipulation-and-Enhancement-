Changes and Notes (HWK 05->06):
 • Everything is complete and fully funcitoning
 • No extra credit was attempted
 • We opted for new interfaces for the GUI
  • Done to support all the new functionality that the GUI requires
    in the controller and view
  • GUI Controller is independent of GUI library used for view


Changes (HWK 04->05):
 • A change we made in our design was adjusting the alpha channel's minimum and maximum value.
 • Before we used a double in the range [0,1].
 • Now we use an int in the range [0, 255] where 255 is opaque.
 • This was done to allow for more precision and have similar behavior to alpha channels elsewhere.


~OUR DESIGN~

We separated our functionality, screen output, and user input into an MVC design.

MODEL:
• Image Processing Application is the controller. 
• Reasoning: IPA is controlling all the information about our images. 
  - Stores named images
  - Access Images
  - Modify Images
  - Add Images

VIEW:
• Text Format
• Render Message
• Render Names in the Program (for convenience)


CONTROLLER:
• Uses Model Commands
• Command Design Pattern -> Scalability
• New Command To Support -> Minimal Changes
• Can be very abstract when doing Filters, Kernels, and Transformations


IMAGES AND PIXELS:
• Image has Pixels
• Pixels represent actual pixels
• Used to store image data
• ImageAdapt uses ImageIO class (adapter pattern)
