~OUR DESIGN~

We separated our functionality, screen output, and user input into an MVC design.

MODEL:
• Image Processing Application is the controller. 
• Reasoning: IPA is controlling all the information about our images. 
  - Stores named images
  - Access Images
  - Modify Images
  - Add Images

VIEW:
• Text Format
• Render Message
• Render Names in the Program (for convenience)


CONTROLLER:
• Uses Model Commands
• Command Design Pattern -> Scalability
• New Command To Support -> Minimal Changes
• Can be very abstract when doing Filters, Kernels, and Transformations


IMAGES AND PIXELS:
• Image has Pixels
• Pixels represent actual pixels
• Used to store image data
• ImageAdapt uses ImageIO class (adapter pattern)
